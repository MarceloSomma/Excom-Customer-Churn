Problems with data

Demographics table:
  problem: inconsistent spelling in gender values (Male, Female, male, female, Ma, F, M)
  solution: fortunately these values are easlily standardized using the following UPDATE statement
  UPDATE demographics
  SET gender = 'Male'
  WHERE gender = 'Ma' OR gender = 'male' OR gender = 'M';
  
  UPDATE demographics
  SET gender = 'Female'
  WHERE gender = 'female' OR gender = 'F';

  problem: null values encountered in age column
  solution: null values will be left intact, later in the analysis/visualization process they will be labeled as unknown

  problem: encountered outlier values of 50 and 999 in n_dependents column, an obvious data entry error in the data
  solution: after consulting with the stakeholders we concluded that the optimal solution was to cap the n_dependents value to 9 using the following UPDATE statement
  UPDATE demographics
  SET n_dependents = 9
  WHERE n_dependents > 9

Location table:
  problem: encountered incorrect values in the country column (Mexico), given that we are a US based company these records would make no sense
  solution: after consulting with stakeholders we decided to replace these out of place values with an 'Out-of-region' value, letting us continue with our analysis for US customers and search for new insights with customers from other regions. The update was done with the following UPDATE statement:
  UPDATE location
  SET country = 'Out-of-region'
  WHERE country != 'United States'

  problem: null values in longitude and latitude columns
  solution: these values will be left as null since they can be easily filtered further down the analysis/visualization process and since they are numeric data types setting a label like 'Unknown' is out of the question

Population table:
  problem: extreme outliers found in the population column low values of 2 and high values of 50000000
  solution: after consulting with stakeholders and doing some research we decided to set a realistic set of values. Given that our data is from the state of California, the range was determined to be between 200 (Amador City) and 4000000 (Los Angeles). This was achieved with the following UPDATE statement:
  UPDATE population
  SET population = CASE
				WHEN population < 200 THEN 200
				WHEN population > 4000000 THEN 4000000
				ELSE population
				END;

Services table:
  problem: found 'Maybe' values in internet_service column which should only contain Yes/No values
  solution: I will replace the 'Maybe' values with 'Unknown' giving it a more relevant label. This will be done with the following UPDATE statement:
  UPDATE services
  SET internet_service = CASE
				WHEN internet_service = 'Maybe' THEN 'Unknown'
				ELSE internet_service
				END

  problem: Null values found in internet_type column
  solution: Null values were replaced with value 'Unknown' maintaining data integrity and improving clarity. This was done with the UPDATE statement:
  UPDATE services
  SET internet_type = CASE
				WHEN internet_type IS NULL THEN 'Unknown'
				ELSE internet_type
				END;

  problem: column 'device_protecion' should be named 'device_protection'
  solution: correct spelling with statement:
  ALTER TABLE services
  RENAME COLUMN device_protecion TO device_protection

  problem: values '---' found in unlimited_data column, possibly due to a data entry error
  solution: replacing '---' values with 'Unknown' maintaining data integrity and improving clarity. This was done with the UPDATE statement:
  UPDATE services
  SET unlimited_data = CASE
				WHEN unlimited_data = '---' THEN 'Unknown'
				ELSE unlimited_data
				END

  problem: found outliers in the monthly_charge column, specifically values of $99999
  solution: after consulting with management I found the cheapest and most expensive plans the company offers, ranging from $18.25 to $130. This lead me to create a threshold for the column from 18.25 to 130 with the following UPDATE statement:
  UPDATE services
  SET monthly_charge = CASE
				WHEN monthly_charge > 130 THEN 130
				WHEN monthly_charge < 18.25 THEN 18.25
				ELSE monthly_charge
				END

Status table:
  problem: null values found in customer_id column (Primary key column)
  solution: since the customer_id uniquely identifies each record, each record with a null customer_id value will be deleted with the following DELETE statement:
  DELETE FROM status
  WHERE customer_id IS NULL

  problem: null values found in satisfaction_score column
  solution: values will be left untouched to maintain data integrity. Further down the analysis/visualization process they may be referred to as 'Unknown' for better understanding

  problem: null values found in churn_category column
  solution: null values will be replaced for 'Unknown' values with the following UPDATE statement:
  UPDATE status
  SET churn_category = CASE
				WHEN churn_category IS NULL THEN 'Unknown'
				ELSE churn_category
				END

  problem: null values found in churn_reason column
  solution: null values will be replaced by 'Don't know', a value already present in the column. This is done with the following UPDATE statement:
  UPDATE status
  SET churn_reason = CASE
				WHEN churn_reason IS NULL THEN 'Don''t know'









# Data Cleaning and Preparation

The goal of this process was to identify and resolve data quality issues, including inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, to ensure the data's integrity and reliability for subsequent analysis.

## Demographics Table üìä

#### Issue: 
The gender column contained inconsistent spelling and capitalization (e.g., 'Male', 'Female', 'male', 'female', 'Ma', 'F', 'M').
#### Solution:
To ensure uniformity, all values were standardized to either 'Male' or 'Female'.
```sql
    UPDATE demographics
    SET gender = 'Male'
    WHERE gender IN ('Ma', 'male', 'M');

    UPDATE demographics
    SET gender = 'Female'
    WHERE gender IN ('female', 'F');
```
#### Issue:
The age column contained null values.
#### Solution:
Null values were retained to preserve the original data. They will be addressed during analysis by labeling them as 'Unknown' for visualization purposes.
  
#### Issue:
The n_dependents column contained outlier values (e.g., 50, 999) that were clearly data entry errors.
#### Solution:
After consulting with stakeholders, a realistic maximum value of 9 was established. Values exceeding this cap were updated to 9.
```sql
    UPDATE demographics
    SET n_dependents = CASE
    WHEN n_dependents > 9 THEN 9
    ELSE n_dependents
    END;
```
## Location Table üìç
#### Issue:
The country column included irrelevant values, such as 'Mexico', which are outside the scope of a US-based company's analysis.
#### Solution:
To focus on US customers while retaining a record of out-of-region data, these values were replaced with 'Out-of-region'.
```sql
    UPDATE location
    SET country = CASE
    WHEN country != 'United States' THEN 'Out-of-region'
    ELSE country
    END;
```
#### Issue:
The longitude and latitude columns contained null values.
#### Solution:
These null values were kept intact, as they can be easily filtered out during the analysis and visualization phases.

## Population Table üó∫Ô∏è
#### Issue:
The population column contained extreme outliers, with values as low as 2 and as high as 50,000,000, which are inconsistent with the dataset's origin in California.
#### Solution:
Based on research and stakeholder consultation, a realistic population range was defined, from 200 (Amador City) to 4,000,000 (Los Angeles). Values outside this range were capped to normalize the data.
```sql
    UPDATE population
    SET population = CASE
    WHEN population < 200 THEN 200
    WHEN population > 4000000 THEN 4000000
    ELSE population
    END;
```
## Services Table üõ†Ô∏è
#### Issue:
The internet_service column contained the invalid value 'Maybe', while the expected values were 'Yes' or 'No'.
#### Solution:
The 'Maybe' values were reclassified as 'Unknown' to maintain data consistency.
```sql
    UPDATE services
    SET internet_service = CASE
    WHEN internet_service = 'Maybe' THEN 'Unknown'
    ELSE internet_service
    END;
```
#### Issue:
The internet_type column contained null values.
#### Solution:
Null values were replaced with 'Unknown' to improve data integrity and clarity.
```sql
    UPDATE services
    SET internet_type = CASE
    WHEN internet_type IS NULL THEN 'Unknown'
    ELSE internet_type
    END;
```
#### Issue:
The column name device_protecion was misspelled.
#### Solution:
The column was renamed to device_protection to correct the spelling.
```sql
    ALTER TABLE services
    RENAME COLUMN device_protecion TO device_protection;
```
#### Issue:
The unlimited_data column contained invalid '---' values.
#### Solution:
These invalid values were replaced with 'Unknown' to ensure data integrity.
```sql
    UPDATE services
    SET unlimited_data = CASE
    WHEN unlimited_data = '---' THEN 'Unknown'
    ELSE unlimited_data
    END;
```
#### Issue:
The monthly_charge column included an extreme outlier of $99,999.
#### Solution:
A realistic range for monthly charges, from $18.25 to $130, was established based on company plan data. Outlier values were capped at these thresholds.
```sql
    UPDATE services
    SET monthly_charge = CASE
    WHEN monthly_charge > 130 THEN 130
    WHEN monthly_charge < 18.25 THEN 18.25
    ELSE monthly_charge
    END;
```
## Status Table üìà
#### Issue:
The customer_id column, which serves as a primary key, contained null values.
#### Solution:
Records with a null customer_id were deleted, as they cannot be uniquely identified.
```sql
    DELETE FROM status
    WHERE customer_id IS NULL;
```
#### Issue:
The satisfaction_score column contained null values.
#### Solution:
The null values were left untouched to maintain the original data. They will be handled during analysis by labeling them as 'Unknown'.
#### Issue:
The churn_category and churn_reason columns contained null values.
#### Solution:
Null values in churn_category were replaced with 'Unknown'. For churn_reason, null values were replaced with the existing 'Don't know' value to maintain consistency.
```sql 
    UPDATE status
    SET churn_reason = CASE
    WHEN churn_reason IS NULL THEN 'Don''t know'
    ELSE churn_reason
    END
```
